% Introduction of the Content and MEC service provider  
Over the years, Internet traffic has grown exponentially around the world. Mainly due to the multimedia content streaming, which, currently, represents 70\% of the whole traffic~\cite{cisco:forecast}. 
The Over-the-top~(OTT) provider can use the network edge to caching and transmit the video traffic with an uninterrupted streaming experience, at least as smooth as possible, to accommodate this growing video demand. This includes current video services as well as innovative services such as Real-time video streams and future games console~(e.g. AWS Wavelength and Google Stadia).
This trend imposes new challenges in video provisioning to satisfy the Quality of Experience~(QoE) guarantees for a wide range of users subscribers. As it is originally designed to consider the best-effort internet model for data transmission~\cite{gamaUCC2019, DBLP:CoRR:2021, ye:ITC17}.
%In order to provide the best user satisfaction, the advantages of high datarate and low latency in the edge network take into account today~\cite{gamaUCC2019, DBLP:CoRR:2021, ye:ITC17}. This trend imposes new challenges in providing videos with the best QoE, originally designed considering the best-effort internet model for data transmission.

In the moment that the content provider saturates available bandwidth or a particular set of service metrics across the network, the cloud server~(OTT provider) can reroute active connections to one or more edge caches that attend to the demand required. Such model can be represented by network organized hierarchically in multi-tiers to maintain a low traffic load~\cite{rosarioSENSORS2018}.
%When the content provider saturates the available bandwidth or a certain set of service metrics, the request may be routed to one or more edge caches. This model may be organized hierarchically in multi-tiers maintains a low traffic load~\cite{rosarioSENSORS2018}.

% Challenges
As well as the advantages of using the edge of the network with cache capabilities help user satisfaction, but it could bring negative impacts as well. When many users start to request video segments at the edge nodes, these surrogated nodes consider static users and just one edge node tiers. These nodes are not ready to deal with the constant changes in the number of users and the process of switching between different Access Points~(AP) due to user mobility.
Several works in the literature highlight edge/cloud computing to deal with the new video traffic demands, but there are aspects little addressed in user dynamic solutions. Figure~\ref{fig:multi-tier-network} depicts a multi-tier network architecture, which is composed of a heterogeneous set of devices and applications using distributed computing resources through multi-access communication technology, such as 5G and WiFi.
%
%Furthermore, the number of users connected in different APs changes accordingly to the surrogated edge nodes. For instance, a core network regional edge node provides video streaming to more users than an edge gateway. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:multi-tier-network}.
%
%Since the triggered video segments caching (replication) in an edge node.
%However, certain precautions when choosing the nodes for caching the video need to be taken into account. 

%Which it could result some issues.

% Objective
Motivated by these characteristics in multi-tier edge/cloud scenarios to improve users' satisfaction, as well as accommodate the growing video traffic. This article presents the need for an orchestrator in real-time to provide video streaming content.
Our goal is to provide designers and operators a performance analysis of a hierarchical edge network and its impacts on the users' QoE. The models we present in this paper are evaluated by a series of simulations using a controlled environment.

% Organization paper
This work is organized as follows.
Section \ref{sec:related-work} presents related work on the impact of edge/cloud networks on video streaming services.
Section \ref{sec:system-archi} briefly analysis the proposed multi-tier edge/cloud network and describe some opportunities of using such environments.
Section \ref{sec:results} shows preliminary results on the impact of the network performance for video streaming services.
Finally, \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes the paper.
