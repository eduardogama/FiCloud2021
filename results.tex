\section{Performance Evaluation}
\label{sec:results}

In this section we describe the experimental evaluation of the algorithm proposed, including the scenarios, metrics, methodology and outcomes.

To deploy a Dash server and the clients allowed to request a multimedia content in DASH format, was used the Adaptive Multimedia Streaming~(AMuSt). The AMust system allow a set o apps to produce and consume the adaptive video, based on Dash pattern. The DASH functionality is provided by the libdash library, an open source library that provides an interface to the DASH standard. Currently, libdash is the reference software official DASH standard.

We simulate the scenario in a binary tree topology of height two.  Firstly, We compare with the cloud-only scenario, without edge server, to the difference with and without the edge use.
